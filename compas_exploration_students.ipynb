    "\n",
    "You will examine the ProPublica COMPAS dataset, which consists of all criminal defendants who were subject to COMPAS screening in Broward County, Florida, during 2013 and 2014. For each defendant, various information fields (‘features’) were also gathered by ProPublica. Broadly, these fields are related to the defendant’s demographic information (e.g., gender and race), criminal history (e.g., the number of prior offenses) and administrative information about the case (e.g., the case number, arrest date, risk of recidivism predicted by the COMPAS tool). Finally, the dataset also contains information about whether the defendant did actually recidivate or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The COMPAS score uses answers to 137 questions to assign a risk score to defendants -- essentially a probability of re-arrest. The actual output is two-fold: a risk rating of 1-10 and a \"low\", \"medium\", or \"high\" risk label.\n",
    "\n",
    "Link to dataset: https://github.com/propublica/compas-analysis\n",

    "The file we will analyze is: compas-scores-two-years.csv\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The project has three parts: \n",
    "\n",
    "- The COMPAS scores have been shown to have biases against certain racial groups. Analyze the dataset to highlight these biases.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Based on the features in the COMPAS dataset, train classifiers to predict who will re-offend (hint: no need to use all features, just the ones you find relevant).  Study if your classifiers are more or less fair than the COMPAS classifier. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Build a fair classifier (last lecture will cover fair classification techniques). Is excluding the race from the feature set enough?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Today\n",
    "\n",
    "Explore the dataset and do some initial statistics. "
